The following scripts and explanations allow you to create your own
word list/dictionary to use with these autoSpell programs if you cannot find a suitable dictionary online.

Some sources for word lists are:
http://wordlist.aspell.net/
http://www.md5this.com/tools/wordlists.html
http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/wordlist.html
http://www.mine-control.com/zack/guttenberg/
https://figshare.com/articles/Word_frequencies_from_Project_Gutenberg_English_texts/1515919


And a pre-sorted list of Latin words (mine) can be found at:
https://archive.org/details/LatinDict

It is best though not required that the dictionary file used with autoSpell be secondarily sorted for word frequency because the program selects the first best match to a word unless it finds an exact match in the dictionary.




#!/bin/bash -
# script make_word_list.sh
# purpose - to make a dictionary word list from a text
# 
# usage: pipe text into this and it prints to standard output
# with 1st col. the word count and 2nd column the word 
#
# This script assumes no words split at line breaks, but additional 
# scripting could join those words.
#
tr -cs A-Za-z\' '\n' |
  tr A-Z a-z |
    sort |
      uniq -c




#!/bin/bash -
#
# script word_list-length.sh
# purpose - to take the file from make_word_list.sh and add a third column
# with the word length (number of characters)
#
# usage: pipe text into this and it prints to standard output
# 
gawk '
{ printf "%s ", $1; printf "%s ", $2; printf "%s\n", length($2) }
' 



So, supposing you found a suitable text file with which to create your dictionary:
cat textfile | make_word_list.sh | word_list-length.sh | sort -k3n -k1nr | cut -d ' ' -f 2

or if you have an existing word list in single column without known word frequencies:
cat wordList | gawk '{ printf "%s ", $1; printf "%s\n", length($1) }' | sort -k2n | cut -d ' ' -f 1
